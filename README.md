# turbo-seedbox

This project deploys a **multi-users** seedbox, using Docker. It will install docker automatically, if needed, and deploy following servers:
- rtorrent: to download torrent.
- sickrage: Automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows. It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its magic.
- couchpotato: same thing but for films.
- headphones: same thing but for music.
- plex, emby and limboserver: to stream videos from your server to your TV or laptop.
- some monitoring tools: glances, plexPy
- muximux: Lightweight portal to your webapps https://github.com/mescon/Muximux
- a VPN server: openVPN.
- a teamspeak server.
- a FTP server, some file managers (https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder), cloud, syncthing, ...
- portainer, butterfly
- WARNING: By default, fail2ban is deployed to protect the host. You have only one try to connect using SSH. If you enter an incorrect password, you will be ban during 1 hour. And you have three tries for websites. See include/fail2ban.


## 0. Download sources
### 0.1 Install Docker
- On Linux:
You can skip this part, it's done automatically.
- On Mac or Windows:
see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

### 0.2 Download sources
On Windows, I recommend you to install this project in your home, i.e.: C:\Users\< user >\docker. (if you use Hyper-V to virtualize the Docker Engine, you can install it where you want)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloneMe/turbo-seedbox.git
cd turbo-seedbox
chmod +x build.sh
```

## 1. Configuration
### 1.1 Create your users
Run the following command to create an user:
```bash
 printf "<user name>:$(openssl passwd -crypt <password>)\n" >> htpasswd.txt
```
Or do nothing and a htpasswd.txt file will be generated with two users: foo and bar, using the password foo.
Example to create bar:
```bash
   printf "bar:$(openssl passwd -crypt foo)\n" >> htpasswd.txt
```

### 1.2 Edit properties in build.sh
By default:
- The host is 192.168.99.100. Please update the `server_name` property.
- All servers with the property at true will be deployed.
- Files created by servers are saved in the parent folder. To use another folder, change the `seedboxFiles` property. Following folders will be created:
 * config
 * downloads
 * log

### 1.3 [optional] Configure your DNS
 Following subdomains can be used: files, explorer. It depends of what you have defined in build.sh.
 If your DNS handle wildcards, you are lucky.
 Otherwise, you need to declare each subdomain.

## 2. Run build.sh
It will:
- Install Docker if needed.
- Generate docker-compose & nginx. These files depend on users in htpasswd.txt. If you add or remove an user, you have to launch ./build.sh again.
- Launch servers.
- Update servers' configuration (Sickrage & Couchpotato).

## 3. Server configuration
**After launching build.sh, a folder named "help" is generated ;)**

Plex
Issue : Plex NEVER asks for authentication. Everybody can access to it :/
`nano $seedboxFiles/config/plex/Library/Application\ Support/Plex\ Media\ Server/Preferences.xml`
There is "Disable Remote Security=1". Changed that 1 to a 0 and restarted my Plex : docker restart seedboxdocker_plex_1

## ...

* To start all servers: `docker-compose up -d`. The first time, take a coffee or a beer ;) This step depends of:
-- your connection, you have to download 1.7G or 3G :/  
-- your CPU, the server will not respond, i.e. console frozen, during a while with an Intel C2350 1,70GHz ;)
* To see logs: `docker-compose logs`
* To stop all servers: `docker-compose stop`
* To stop all servers+: `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`
* To check resources used: `docker stats`
* all containers use restart, so run the following command to not launch containers at startup:
`docker-compose rm`
* To remove images: `docker ps -a |  awk '{print $1}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty docker rm`
* Delete all containers `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`
* Delete all images `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`


##### To note
* On all pages, you should have a popup asking your login/password.
* On http://__your domain.com__/couchpotato, if you have a page displaying "NON". It means that nginx is working but your couchpotato server does not have a correct configuration.
* If after some tries, the popup asking your login/password does not show up, it means you have been banned during one hour :p (set fail2ban to false to authorize brute force attacks ;)
* If file=true and you have "_This site canâ€™t be reached files.domain.com's server DNS address could not be found. ERR NAME NOT RESOLVED_", please check your DNS configuration OR wait a while.




# [For dev]
- run  `cp build.sh local.sh` and work with local.sh
## Windows users
- Edit your C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

And add (if the docker's IP is 192.168.99.100, run "docker-machine ip default" to know it)
```
192.168.99.100 dock
192.168.99.100 files.dock
192.168.99.100 explorer.dock
```
Then you can access to servers using these urls:
```
http://files.dock
http://explorer.dock
```
## Linux users
- Edit your /etc/hosts
```
127.0.0.1 dock
...
```

## Why?
I did this to learn and because I could not find a seedbox easy to install & multi-users.

Kiss.
